## Project

Name: Apache Commons Collections

URL: https://github.com/apache/commons-collections

The Apache Commons Collections package contains types that extend and augment the Java Collections Framework.

## Onboarding experience

The overall onboarding experience of Apache Commons Collections was very smooth, and we decided to continue with the project. As described in the README, The only required tools were a Java JDK and Maven, which we had already installed. The other dependencies were automatically installed by Maven. The build compiled without errors and the tests ran successfully. There were a small number of warnings but these could safely be ignored.
